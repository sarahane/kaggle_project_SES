We will use a filtered dataset for face recognition on LFW. Out of the 5749 people in the LFW dataset, many of them have only 1 or 2 images which makes them unsuitable candidates for training a face classifier. Hence, we filter out the persons with at least 70 images in the dataset, and end up with 7 classes. We also crop and resize each image from 250 x 250 to 50 x 37 (less dimensions to work with too!) and split the data into train and test. Images are single-channel with pixel intensity represented by a float value from 0 to 255, the single-channel intensity is the mean value of the original RGB channel intensities.

Final details of dataset

Number of data: 1288 (966 train, 322 test)
Number of features: 1850 (50 x 37 pixels after resizing and cropping)
Number of classes: 7

File descriptions

X_train.npy: training data numpy array. Each row in the array corresponds to an image unrolled to a vector (50 x 37 = 1850 dimension)

y_train.npy: labels (0-6) of each data corresponding to the image in the same row in X_train.npy

X_test.npy: testing data numpy array for evaluation of your models. The prediction outputs on this test data is to be submitted for scoreboard

All files are saved as numpy arrays, you can load them using numpy.load.
